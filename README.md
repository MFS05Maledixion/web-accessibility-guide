# WEB ACCESSIBILITY GUIDE

## Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can:
- perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
- contribute to the Web

## Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including:
- auditory
- cognitive
- neurological
- physical
- speech
- visual


## Web accessibility standards
* Web accessibility relies on several components that work together. Some of these include:
- Web content - refers to any part of a website, including text, images, forms, and multimedia, as well as any markup code, scripts, applications, and such.
- User agents - software that people use to access web content, including desktop graphical browsers, voice browsers, mobile phone browsers, multimedia players, plug-ins, and some assistive technologies.
- Authoring tools - software or services that people use to produce web content, including code editors, document conversion tools, content management systems, blogs, database scripts, and other tools.

## TOOLS

* IMAGES
- alt text for screen readers (for any images that provide helpful information i.e photos, icons) the exception being decorative pieces i.e background images, dividers
- short and simple is best
- dont start with this is an image of... 'screen readers will read that it's an image'
- Adding on WordPress: <!-- Open up your Media Library and select the image you want to edit. The Settings screen for that image will open up. In the Alternative Text field, add your alt text, then click Save --> 

* COLORS
- provide adequate color contrast, this will help with users with poor vision, color-blind users, or people using certain devices
- Images, text, and elements like buttons all need proper color contrast
- Color contrast refers to how bright or dark colors appear when placed against or very near each other
- e.g black text on a white background has a much higher color contrast (21:1) than yellow text on a white background (1.08:1). WCAG 2.0 AA requires a minimum of a 4.5:1 ratio for normal text and 3:1 for larger text (bold 18px or standard 24px and larger).

* TEXT
- fonts and size
- An accessible font is easy to read at small and large sizes.
- e.g  Tahoma, Calibri, Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Times New Roman, Arvo, Museo Slab, and Rockwell are all accessible choices.
- Readers with dyslexia may find it challenging to read certain fonts, including many serif fonts.
- Sans-serif fonts for body text tend to be a safer choice. It’s best to avoid display fonts — like handwriting styles or cursive — unless the text is large, sparse, and mostly decorative.
- take note of capitalization on fonts, with some fonts capital letters are indistinguishable from small letters.
- Default fonts should be at least 9pt or 12px. 12pt or 16px is recommended. According to WCAG Guidelines, the text should be able to be read when zoomed to 200%.
